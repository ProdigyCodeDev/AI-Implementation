        <p>      Artificial Intelligence (AI) are the automated technologies developed by engineers to perform and simplify tasks for humans. AI is present in daily life in many technologies. AI is present
            in electronic devices such as phones and smart watches in the form of virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and google-assistant. AI is present in many appliances including apple, samsung, and 
            google ecosystems that include smart fridges, lighting systems, and climate controls. Recently, AI has been heavily involved in the automobile industry with many electric and luxury cars such as Tesla 
            and Audi becoming availible with automated driving solutions, ecosystem integration, and other AI technologies. 
             AI is an attractive tool and product for businesses and companies to utilize because it can increase
            output, product versatility, and provide an desired technology. AI technologies are useful for both the consumer and company. Companies can produce products more efficeintly and customers
            can recieve more technologically advanced products.

        <p>
            AI is becoming used more and more by businesses and companies and is high in demand, which makes it necesary for businesses to implement AI to prevent them from becoming
                outclassed by other companies. It is important to remember that AI is still largely in developmental stages, and cannot be fully independent. Consistent human involvement
                is required through product monitoring, updates, and fixes. AI is not without problems, and early AI implementations have had numerous setbacks including recalls and lawsuits,
                whichhave damaged companies repeutation, output, and profits.

        <p>The use of AI in consumer products by companies and businesses has been heavily contraversial. Several major issues with AI have occured causing danger to consumers and inconvinices.
            It is not uncommon for vitual assistants to have bugs and automated vehicles to be recalled because of AI problems. If AI is not properly monitored and developed it can cause many problems. 
            The major problem with AI is that is prone to failure. These failures can be detrimental to both consumers and the businesses and companies that implement them.

                <ul>
                    <li>AI failure in production process -deffective products and stalled production  </li>
                    <li>AI faulure in service products - loss of customers base and mandatory recalls </li>
                    <li>AI failure resulting in harm - lawsuits and damaged company repeutation</li>
                    <li>Failure is AI dev - major costly AI malfunctions and unintended consequences</li>

            <div class = "col" style="border:0px solid blue;">
                
        <h4>Detriments to Consumers and Society:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Job loss and crashed economies</li>
            <li> Unnecessary risk to humans</li>
            <li> Poor reliability and quality of products</li>
            <li> Global security problems including hacking and terrorism </li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <p>AI still has many limitations and cannot yet be fully rellied on or independent. The malfunctioning of AI in a production
        stage could result in the crippling of a businesses output and profits. The incorrect implementation could result in AI that becomes
        outdated, unreliable, and potentially dangerous to use. As human continue to implement AI in the business aspect, it is important for businesses to take into 
        consideration the safety of their customers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Failing the implement AI would also be harmful to output and profits, as companies that implement AI effectively, 
        would gain a larger market and base to sell products, reducing the customer base and the saleworthy value
        of the companies that fail to implement in the rapidly progressing market.

        <p>Business and companies can avoid problems with implementing AI by following an detailed testing program. 
            The program should include repeated trial and testing in controlled enviroments before releasing experimental versions.
        AI should be updated and improved routinely and used securely. Additionally, businesses and companies should have AI
    management teams that monitor and control AI.  AI legal teams should also be created to evaluate the uses of AI. The creation of there 
AI specialist teams would create jobs and create security for a company to maintain AI systems whether in factories or on the internet. For example, while amazons packaging and assembly lines are largely
automated by mechanical parts and machinese, workers are still hired to maintain machines, supervise production, and resolve iregullarities that machines cannot resolve. The key to
properly implementing AI is taking a cautious approach to the engineering and monitoring of AI, in order to ensure humans remain in control of
the capabilities and maintain the function of the AI being used.
<br>
<br>

It would also be beneficial for AI laws and terms of use to be established for businesses and companies to detail what 
is ethical and legal for the uses of AI. AI has been used in robots for defense purposes and millitary applications, which raises the question whether or not
it should be allowed for countries to use AI to harm people. AI legal teams would also play a role in determining the appropiate application of AI and evaluate its potential risk
and benefits for the company and consumer.</p>
